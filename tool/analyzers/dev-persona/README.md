# Developer Persona Analyzer

A fun, choice-based analyzer that infers your developer persona
based on how you make decisions.

### Dimensions
- logic
- speed
- structure
- chaos

### How it works
Each choice contributes weighted scores to different dimensions.
Final scores are normalized and matched against predefined personas.
