# VR-OS Project

A next-generation **VR-native Operating System**, built with JavaScript/TypeScript runtime and modular VR shell. This project aims to create a new paradigm where VR is not an app on top of an OS, but the OS itself.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Vision

* Build a **VR-first operating system** with a modular and extensible shell.
* Use **Linux Kernel** as initial base for hardware support, with a future plan to replace it with a fully custom VR-native core.
* Provide a **JavaScript/TypeScript API layer** (powered by V8/Deno) for fast development and ecosystem growth.
* Ensure compatibility with traditional OS (Windows/macOS/Linux) via virtualization "pipes", but keep VR-OS as the **host world**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ System Architecture

### 1. Kernel Layer

* **Stage 1 (MVP)**: Linux Kernel for hardware drivers, GPU/VR device support, networking, filesystem, and virtualization (KVM/QEMU).
* **Stage 2 (Optimized)**: Stripped-down Linux Kernel, tailored for VR-only workloads (low latency, high FPS, minimal I/O overhead).
* **Stage 3 (Future)**: Custom VR-native kernel, optimized scheduler and GPU pipeline.

### 2. Runtime / API Layer

A custom **abstraction API** built on top of V8/Deno.

Key responsibilities:

* Abstract away Linux syscalls.
* Provide **stable JS/TS API** so apps run regardless of underlying kernel.
* Manage VR input/output pipeline.

**Core API Modules (Draft v1):**

* `FS` â†’ Filesystem (read/write/permissions)
* `Net` â†’ Networking (sockets, HTTP, peer-to-peer)
* `VR` â†’ VR device access (headset pose, controller input, haptics)
* `UI` â†’ 3D interface elements (panels, buttons, holograms)
* `Input` â†’ Keyboard, mouse, gestures, voice
* `App` â†’ App lifecycle management (install, run, sandbox)
* `VM` â†’ Virtual OS management (pipe into Windows/macOS/Linux)
* `Sys` â†’ System info & configuration (battery, performance, settings)

### 3. VR Shell (Frontend)

* Fully modular 3D interface.
* Core modules:

  * **Desktop World**: 3D environment as the root shell.
  * **File Explorer**: Navigate VR filesystem as objects/rooms.
  * **App Launcher**: Manage native VR apps and virtual OS pipes.
  * **Control Center**: System settings, network, hardware status.
  * **Multi-screen/Room System**: Each OS/app can be a room or holographic screen.

## ðŸ”¹ Development Roadmap

### Stage 1: MVP (Prototype)

* Linux Kernel + V8 runtime + basic VR shell.
* Implement `VR`, `FS`, and minimal `UI` API.
* Simple 3D desktop + file viewer + app launcher.

### Stage 2: Alpha (Developer Preview)

* Release JS/TS SDK for VR-native app development.
* Add `Net`, `Input`, and `Sys` APIs.
* Integrate virtualization (run Windows/Linux inside VR shell as panels/rooms).

### Stage 3: Beta (Ecosystem Growth)

* Modularize shell components (desktop, explorer, control center).
* Add plugin system (developers can extend shell functionality).
* Begin stripping Linux kernel (optimize for VR-only performance).

### Stage 4: 1.0 (Commercial Launch)

* Stable API layer.
* VR-native app store.
* Optimized kernel for VR workloads.
* Polished multi-room/multi-screen VR shell.

### Stage 5: Long-Term (Full VR Kernel)

* Replace Linux with custom VR-native kernel.
* Optimized scheduler for VR render loop (low-latency frame guarantee).
* Native GPU/VR drivers (if partnerships are possible).
* VR-native security and networking stack.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Start with Linux?

* Plug-and-play drivers for thousands of devices.
* KVM/QEMU built-in for virtualization.
* Proven stability and security.
* Shortens time-to-market, allowing focus on VR OS shell & API ecosystem.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Developer Philosophy

* **Abstract First, Optimize Later**: API stability matters more than kernel choice.
* **Modularity**: Every shell component should be replaceable.
* **Forward Compatibility**: Apps written for VR-OS today must still run after kernel replacement tomorrow.
* **VR as Default, Not Optional**: Unlike Windows/Mac/Linux where VR is a mode, VR-OS is the environment.

## ðŸ”¹ Next Steps

1. Finalize core API spec (`VR`, `FS`, `UI`).
2. Build MVP VR shell prototype on Linux + V8.
3. Release documentation & SDK for developer feedback.

ðŸš€ **VR-OS is not just an operating system. It's a new world.**
