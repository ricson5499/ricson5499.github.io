# AI Usage for Junior Developers
*Using AI as a tool, not a crutch*

AI has become part of everyday development work:
writing code, fixing bugs, generating solutions, even running agents.

But for junior developers, AI is both an accelerator **and** a risk amplifier.

Used well, it speeds up learning.
Used poorly, it hides problems, delays failure, and creates technical debt.

This article is not about *whether* to use AI,
but **how to use it without losing your ability to think and maintain your own code**.

## Rule 1: Code You Don’t Understand Is Code You Didn’t Write

This is the most important rule.

If AI gives you code and you cannot answer:
- Why is it written this way?
- What problem does this line solve?
- Where would you start debugging if it breaks?

Then that code should **not** enter your project yet.

AI-generated code:
- does not understand your system context
- does not take responsibility for production issues
- will not help you debug six months later

> AI can generate code.  
> **You are still responsible for it.**

Treat AI as:
- advanced search
- experience aggregation

Not as:
- a black box that replaces thinking

## Rule 2: Be Clear About Goals, Not Micro-Steps

Many beginners fall into one of two extremes.

### Too vague
- “Just make it work”
- “Something like this”
- “The general direction is fine”

This often produces answers that *look* correct but are fragile and unpredictable.

### Too detailed
- Forcing exact steps
- Locking implementation choices
- Turning assumptions into constraints

This can prevent AI from suggesting better or more mature approaches.

### A better approach
- Clearly state the **goal**
- Describe **constraints**
- Explain the **usage context**
- Explicitly say what you **don’t want**

Sometimes giving a **concept** works better than giving a step-by-step plan,
because AI may know approaches you haven’t considered.

## Rule 3: New Does Not Mean Better — Stability Usually Wins

AI is very good at suggesting:
- new frameworks
- new syntax
- new patterns
- cutting-edge solutions

In real projects, especially for juniors:

> Code that is readable, debuggable, and maintainable  
> beats code that is “cool”.

Often the better choice is:
- a few more lines of code
- one less dependency
- a technique you fully understand

> Technology is not a race to be new.  
> It is a commitment to be usable over time.

## Rule 4: AI Can Help You Write, But It Cannot Help You Grow

If your workflow is:
- copy
- paste
- it runs → done

You gain short-term speed, but lose long-term skill.

Better usage looks like:
- asking AI *why* it chose a solution
- comparing alternatives
- discussing trade-offs

Think of AI as:
> a senior engineer who never gets tired of explaining  
—not a replacement for learning.

---

## Rule 5: Always Preserve the Ability to Take Over

Ask yourself:

1. If AI disappeared tomorrow, could I maintain this?
2. If a bug appears later, do I know where to start?
3. Am I using AI with understanding, or trusting it blindly?

If these questions make you uncomfortable,
you are probably moving faster than your foundation allows.

## Final Thought

AI will not replace developers.

But developers who stop thinking
will slowly lose control over their own systems.

The strongest skill is not “using AI more”,
but **knowing when to rely on it and when to step back**.
